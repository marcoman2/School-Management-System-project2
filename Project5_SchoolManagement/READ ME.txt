To debug, you need to change this on database name:
Connection connect = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/yourDatabaseName", "root" ,"");

and you need to edit the login section, signup section, so much more that required to identify your own table on your database.

That's it!

Thank you and goodluck!

Happy learning guys!
